			A better match between my interests and the opportunity to build something amazing couldn't be made.
			Building things is one of my greatest joys; that should be evident from the work I put into my CTO "application".
			I also share the belief that the narrative for Africa needs to be changed. 
			And in my opinion opening entrepreneurial links between the continent and the diaspora is one of the best ways to achieve that.

				<p class="text-center">
					When I say social I don't mean social in the sense of charity or aid but the ability to bring people together.
					My first trip to Africa was to take a course at the University of Cape Town because I wanted to meet people who were like me.
					With the team of curators that you are building the exact type of interactions I would be looking for are at my fingertips.

					In my opinion Tastemakers Africa occupies a unique space ripe for innovation. 
					It is very appealing to me to build on top of the unprecedented data on the African leisure space that the app is collecting.
